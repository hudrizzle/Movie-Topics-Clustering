# Movie-Topics-Clustering

### Summary
In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster synopses of Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time from IMDB into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

### Data
A list of the 100 movies and their synopses from IMDB and Wikipedia are in [data_imdb](synopses_list_imdb.txt), [data_wiki](synopses_list_wiki.txt) and [titles](title_list.txt).

### Results
Data processing and modeling are shown in [Movie_Clustering.ipynb](Movie_Clustering.ipynb).
